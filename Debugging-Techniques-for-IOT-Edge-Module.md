Debugging a Docker container running on an IoT Edge device involves several steps and could potentially require different strategies depending on what exactly you're trying to debug. Here are some general steps you could take:

1. **View Logs**: One of the most straightforward ways to debug a container is to view its logs. This can be achieved using the `docker logs` command:

    ```
    docker logs <container_id>
    ```

    Replace `<container_id>` with your container's ID or name. You can find the ID of your container by using the `docker ps` command. This will list all running containers along with their IDs. 

    For Azure IoT Edge, you can use the `iotedge logs` command:

    ```
    iotedge logs <module_name>
    ```

    Replace `<module_name>` with the name of your IoT Edge module.

2. **Inspect Running Containers**: Use the `docker inspect <container_id>` command to get more detailed information about the running container. This command will provide you a JSON output detailing the configuration of the container, its current state, and much more.

3. **Interact with a Running Container**: If you have a shell in your Docker container, you can use `docker exec` to interact with a running container. 

    ```
    docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash
    ```

    The `-it` flag allows you to interact with the terminal, and `/bin/bash` opens a bash shell in the container. If your container doesn't include `/bin/bash`, you can try `/bin/sh` or other shell that's included in the container.

4. **Debugging Tools**: If you're debugging a specific programming language like Python, Node.js, etc., you might also attach a debugger to your application. 

5. **Monitor IoT Edge**: Use Azure's monitoring features to collect and view logs and metrics. Azure Monitor, Azure Log Analytics, and Azure Application Insights are valuable tools for analyzing the behavior of your edge devices.

6. **Debugging Locally**: If possible, try to replicate the issue on a local environment. This makes it easier to test and debug. You can use Visual Studio Code with the Azure IoT Edge extension, which provides a local development experience for creating, testing, and debugging Azure IoT Edge modules.

Remember, the ability to debug effectively might require specific tooling or configurations depending on your container's setup and the software it's running. If you can provide more specific information about the container and what it's running, more targeted advice can be given.
